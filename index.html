              Anki is the premier spaced repetition software and I have used it
              for the last 5 years or so. In the software, you create flashcards
              that you review periodically based on how well you remember the
              flashcard. The software and it’s methods yield such a strong
              result that it’s the gold standard for medical students who must
              memorize thousands of facts and images. Best of all, it’s open
              source with plugin support and a community that creates plugins to
              expand its use cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              I personally use it for a myriad of topics, but mainly as a way to
              not forget certain facts. For example, I have cards based on books
              and articles I’ve read. In my undergrad, whenever a course had a
              final exam, Anki was the only studying I needed. Between creating
              and reviewing cards, there wasn’t much dedicated cramming before
              finals.

              Plan is a calendar/project manager that I use for all of my
              personal projects, etc. I mainly use Plan as a hub for all the
              tasks and projects I have to get done. It functions as a calendar
              and to-do list of sorts for me. I can write down a task and assign
              it to a group or project it belongs to and schedule it. It has
              great utility in a team environment but I haven’t had a chance to
              use it in that context. It’s a little rough around the edges and I
              wish it wasn’t but for the very basic use case I have for it, it’s
              perfect.

              Notion is the successor to Plan once I have all of it's feature
              rich design well understood. It's an application that can almost
              do it all. I've used it in the past and currently as the main
              location of class and lecture notes. In the screenshot above, you
              can see that it has a great markdown editor that allows for
              toggled lists and code blocks. I recently began using the code
              blocks for this course and it has been great for building my own
              resource for all the minutiae that you pick up trying to center
              anything in CSS.

              Vimium C is a Chrome extension that allows for the navigation of
              web pages from just keyboard input. It’s a fork of Vimium but
              rewritten in C-style code, it’s still written in TypeScript. It
              has VIM inspired keyboard shortcuts but I’ve found that using it
              doesn’t translate into using VIM well. There’s a learning curve to
              using the extension but I’ve found that the time saved from using
              it more than makes up for it. You navigate web-pages using ‘j’ and
              ‘k’ to scroll up and down respectively. To “click” a link you
              first press ‘f’ after which link hints will pop up and then you’ll
              be able to type those in and ‘click’ that link.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you get even a little proficient with it, you begin realizing
              how slow it is to use the mouse for interacting with anything.
              Switching tabs and then navigating them from the keyboard also
              genuinely feels cool to do but more important than the aesthetics
              is how efficient it feels. It’s fair to assume that we all type
              much faster than we can snap a cursor accurately on a pixel on
              screen. The mouse pointer is only hindrance once you get
              accustomed to this way of browsing the internet.

              The Marvelous Suspender is a fork of the Great Suspender add-on
              for Chrome. It’s an extension that replaces an inactive tab with a
              custom HTML page. It greatly reduces the system resources used by
              Chrome to maintain tabs open and active. It also has some light
              session management tools that I barely use. I mainly interact with
              the internet through laptops and reducing the use of system
              resources helps a lot with battery life and performance. It’s an
              instant install for any laptop I’ve owned since 2016 or so.
            </p>
            <p>
              I mentioned it is a fork of another extension because that
              extension was sold and the new owner included what some users
              believed to be malware or tracking capabilities. That whole fiasco
              should have taught me some sort of lesson but if anything, it
              makes me believe a whole lot more in open source software and
              their communities.
